# Mac_os_Sequoia_Hackintosh_Latitude_5480
Mac os Sequoia (15.3.1) hackintosh EFI for the Dell Latitude 5480

Specs:

Intel Core i5-6200U

Intel HD Graphics 520

16 GB RAM DDR4

Intel wifi and bluetooth card (The sticker is peeled off and i didn't look at it on windows lol)

Everything works, the mouse is a bit laggy and the wifi icon is broken, but it's fixed by using HeliPort

Kinda nice for being my first hackintosh :D
